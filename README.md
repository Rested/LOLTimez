### Todo
- Make timer non-blocking
- Make it work for borderless mode
- Make it work for fullscreen mode

### What it is
Time summoner spells in league of legends by typing 
  >/n xy z*(optional)*
  in the chat
  
  
  where:
  - **x**=summoner (number 1-5), 
  - **y**=spell (number 1-2), 
  - **z**=time ago that spell was used

You will need an api key [from here](https://developer.riotgames.com/).
The program shows up only when the game is running.
The program displays as in screenshot this, spells go grey and get timer on them when command input:
